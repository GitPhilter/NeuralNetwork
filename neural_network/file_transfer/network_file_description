Network files are used for archiving neural networks as simple txt files. To make them recognizable, they use
the file ending '.nn', which obviously is short for 'neural network'.
The basic principle is that there are keywords and values, where keywords always occupy a single line for themselves,
followed by the respective value(s).
In the following structure, empty lines are only used for readability.

network_class
<class_name>

network_name
<network_name>

layer

node_class
<class_name>

node_name
<node_name>

weights
<weight>

bias
<bias>
