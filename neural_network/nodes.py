"""
Provide nodes for usage in a neural network.

Nodes basically have a name, an activation_function, weights and a bias.
Note that the bias is kept as a single variable and not a member of the list of weights. This makes it easier to
extract the bias from the outside without having to wonder at what index in the weights-list it might be.
The init-functions might differ according to what information is really unique to a given instance of a given type of
node.
Alongside the nodes are functions to generate random nodes, i.e. nodes with random weights and bias.
